# SunnySide-Agency
This is a solution to the [Sunnyside agency landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef).

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size


### Useful resources

- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) - This helped me in understanding most of the javascript concepts. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Scrimba](https://www.scrimba.com) - This is an amazing site in which their tutorial video  helped me finally understand how to do this. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
